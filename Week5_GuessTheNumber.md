# Week 3: Guess The Number
Building a **command-line** (text only) program that will ask the user to guess a number between 1 and 100. When the user guesses, the program will tell the user if it is too high, low, or correct.

## What Is Needed To Make This Game:
* Generate a random number between 1 and 100 (for the user to guess).
* Display message asking the user to guess a number (from 1 to 100).
* Accept the user’s guess as a variable we can use in our program.
* Compare the user’s guess to the computer’s number to see if the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
* Display a message "too high", "too low", or "correct".
* Prompt the user to guess another number until they match.
* Ask the user if they’d like to play again.


## Generating A Random Number
* Before we can generate a random number, first we need to create a variable to store the value in. 
* The number we want to generate will be a **whole number** between 1 and 100, this variable should be declared as an **int**.
* To generate a random number it requires the use of the **Math** class that is built into Java.
* Within the **Math** Class the method **Math.random()** generates a random decimal number between 0.0 and 1.0. 
* Because our game requires a random whole number to be generated, we need to convert this decimal into a number between 1 and 100. We can do this by multipling the decimal generated by 100.  
* By doing this the number will range from 0.0 to 99.9 Storing it as an int, the number after the decimal point will drop. To ensure the number is never 0 and reaches 100, we will add 1. 
* **(int)** is added before our random function to **cast** , or change, the decimal number as an integer. 
* This statement should read as the following:

* Add a **println** to ensure your number generator is running correctly. This program should print out a different number each time it is run.

## Storing User Input
* To accept keyboard input from the user, additional Java capabilities from a **utilities** package. 
* **Libraries** and **packages** are sets of code that someone else has created. To use these capabilities the packages need to be **imported**. 
* The class **Scanner** that is part of the **java.util** utilities package, provides several useful functions for working with keyboard input.
* To import the **Scanner** class within this utility package, use the following line of code:

![import line](https://openresty.org/download/image/import.png)

* This line of code gets added before we do anything else, even before we define our class. This is so that the computer imports this package before looking for anything else within the program. 
* In order to use the methods in this class for input first we need to store an **instance (object)** of the class in a variable that pulls input from the keyboard,**System.in** like this:

![creating an instance](https://openresty.org/download/image/instance.png)

* Once an instance is created, methods within the class can be called. 
* **nextLine()** will accept the next line of string data input from the keyboard
* **nextInt()** will accept the next line of string data and turn the text input from the keyboard into an integer number 
* To store this data as a variable first, it needs to be **declared** as an **int**. This variable can be set as equal to 0. 
* Then a message need to be displayed to prompt the user to "guess" a number between 1 and 100. We do this by using the same **println()** method from the **System** class that was used in HelloWorld.
* Now that the user knows what kind of input the program is expecting from them, the keyboard needs to be checked for input. To do this we call the **nextInt()** method of our Scanner instance by using **dot notation** and store it in the variable created for user input, like this:

![accepting user input as int](https://openresty.org/download/image/nextInt.png)

* Add a **println** to ensure your the program is running correctly. This program should print out the same number that the user input.

## Using Loops To Ask,Check & Repeat
* **Loops** give us the ability to repeat actions multiple times without writing large amounts of repeatitive code.
* **While** loops repeat a set of commmands as long as the condition is true.
* A **condition** is just something that can be tested. For example, is the number that the user guessed the same as the number that was randomly generated. 
* In this case, if the numbers do not match the user should be able to continue guessing, and the loop should continue repeating. If the user's guess is correct the game should stop. 


## Vocabulary
	Classes are like templates that make it easier to create objects, or instances of that class. If you think of a class as a cookie cutter, objects are the cookies. And, just like a cookie cutter, classes are reusable, so once we’ve built a useful class, we can reuse it over and over to create as many objects as we want.
	camel case for class names with multiple words, beginning each new word with a capital letter, as in HiLo, GuessingGame, and BubbleDrawApp. The words look like they have humps in the middle, just like a camel.

	**Libraries** and **packages** are sets of code that someone else has created. To use these capabilities the packages need to be **imported**. 

	dot notation, which lists a class or object, followed by a dot and then a method or an attribute of that class or object. 
	Methods are the functions in an object or class.
	Attributes are the values stored in an object or class.
