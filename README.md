- Using The Command Line
- IDE's & IntelliJ
- Syntax & Variables
- Vocabulary:
- Keywords:

### [July 15: Math, Operators & Conditionals](https://github.com/compagnb/IntroToObjectOrientedProgramming-Java/blob/master/Week2_VariablesMathOperators.md)
- Review Variables
- Operators
- **Example Code:**
- **In-Class Assignment:** Write a program that uses all of the Arithmetic Operators, storing the result of each operator into its own variable. Then print out what the operator and result are. (i.e. "The sum of 5 and 4 is 9.")
- **Vocabulary:** Variable, Primitive Data Type, Reference/Object Data Type, Integer, Floating Number, Boolean, Strongly Typed Language, Loosely Typed Language, Scope, Arithmetic Operators
- **Keywords:** byte, short, int, long, float, double, Boolean, char, String, +, -, * , /, =, %, ++, --, >, <, !=, ==, <=, >=, &&, ||,  !

### [July 22: Conditional/Control-Flow Statements](https://github.com/compagnb/IntroToObjectOrientedProgramming-Java/blob/master/Week3_Conditionals.md)
- Review Operators
- Conditionals
- Switch
- Math Package Methods
- Generating Random Numbers
- Casting
- **Example Code:**
- **In-Class Assignment:** Using the checklist we created in class, and using conditional statements to print the appropriate output for the guessing game. (i.e. if the user guesses a larger number, the program should say "too high", etc.). When complete, build out the random number generated using Java's Math class.
- **Vocabulary:** Relational Operators, Logical Operators, Cast, Command-Line
- **Keywords:** if, else, elseif, switch, break, Math, random()

### [July 29: Arrays & More Control Flow](https://github.com/compagnb/IntroToObjectOrientedProgramming-Java/blob/master/Week4_ArraysControlFlowStatements.md)
- Arrays
- User Input
- For
- While
- Do While
- **Example Code:**
- **In-Class Assignment:** Using the scanner class, build into our guessing game a feature that will store user input. Then using loops, build in a feature where the user is asked again until they guess correctly. Once guessed correctly have the user given the option to play again. (Thing about loops here too!) **Advanced:**  Using arrays, respond to the userâ€™s input with warmer or cooler (using their last guess as a point to compare from.
- **Vocabulary:** array, index, one-dimensional array, multi-dimensional array, loops, loop control statements, break, continue,
- **Keywords:** length, for, while, do, break, continue
