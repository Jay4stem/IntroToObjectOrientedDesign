## Control Flow & Methods
## Arrays
* **Arrays** are objects that hold multiple values of the same data type.
* Arrays are marked by placing **square brackets** after the variable name, or data type like this:

* Each item in the array has its own **index (or position number)**. The index always starts at zero.
* Create an instance of an array like this:

* The size of an array must be declared before assigning any values. If you do not know how many valuables you will be storing you cannot us an array.  
* The items in the array can be assigned individually by using the index number like this:

* All arrays have an attribute called **length**, Like other languages, such as python, this will return the amount of items in the array. 

* Arrays can be declared and initialized in one line of code, like this:

* Similar to assigning the items in the array individually, they can also be used in code using the index number.

* These arrays are considered **one-dimensional**. This simply means they are essentially a list of variables. There are also **multi-diensonal** arrays that are more complex. 

## Loops
* **Loops** are statements that execute a statement or group of statements multiple times. 
* There are three types of loops:
  * The **while** loop repeats a statement (or group of statements) while a given condition is true. It also tests the condition before running the statments witin the loop body.
  * The **for** loop runs a sequence of statements a set number of times, iteratively.
  * The **do** **while** loop is similar to a **while** loop, but it tests the condition at the end of the loop body.
* Statements that can change the sequence of the loop, are known as **control statements**. These statements are:
  * The **break** statement will terminate the loop or (just like the switch statement).  It will break out of the loop and run the code immediately following the loop (or switch).
  * The **continue** statement will cause the loop to skip the remainder of its body. It will retest the condition prior before re-running the code.
