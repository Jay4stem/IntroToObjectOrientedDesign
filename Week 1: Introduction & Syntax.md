# Week 1: Introduction & Syntax

## Java Program Processing
* **Java is platform independent** – the same java program can run on many different platforms (like Windows, OSX & Linus) without changing a line of code. 
* Java requires three main steps:
  * **Write** the code and save it to a file.
  * **Compile** the program to translate it from the Java language into byte code that Java Virtual Machine understands.
  * **Run** the program. 
* During compilation, Java code, or **source code**, gets converted into another language called **“ByteCode”**.  ByteCode is the same for the program no matter what operating system the source code is written or run on. 
* **Java Virtural Machine** interprets the byte code into instructions that the operating system understands.
