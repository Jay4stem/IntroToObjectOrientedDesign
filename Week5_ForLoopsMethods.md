# Week 5: For Loops & Methods

## For Loops
* A **for** loop iterates over a range of values.
* The syntax of a for loop is as follows:
```java
   for (initialization; termination; increment) {
      statement(s)
   }
```
   * **initialization** initializes the loop. It is only executed once, when the loop begins.
   * **termination** sets the limit for the loop to end.
   * **increment** adds to the value after each time through the loop (or iteration). It can also be a decrement.
* The variable that controls a for statement (i) should be declared within the initialization expression, when able to limit their life span and reduce errors. Usually these variables take the names i, j, and k.
* Below is an example of how to count to 10 using a for loop:
```java
   class ForCount {
      public static void main(String[] args){
         for(int i=1; i<11; i++){
            System.out.println("Count is: " + i);
         }
      }
   }

```
* Three expressions are optional. To create an **infinite loop** use the following:
```java
// infinite loop
   for ( ; ; ) {
      // your code goes here
   }
```
* **For** Loops are great for executing actions for each item in an **arrays** or collections. This is sometimes referred to as an **enhanced for loop** or a **for each**.
* Below is an example of using an enhanced for loop to count to 10:
```java
   class EnhancedForCount {
      public static void main(String[] args){
         int[] numbers =
             {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10};
         for (int item : numbers) {
             System.out.println("Count is: " + item);
         }
      }
   }
```

## Loop Control Statements

## Methods
* Methods allow code to be reusable, readable, structured & organized. This stops us from having crazy code fingers!
* **Calling** a method means we execute the code within it.
* The syntax for a method is as follows:
```java
visibility static/instance returnType methodName (parameter1, parameter2, ...){
   lines of code
}
```
* An example of how a method to calculate the sum of two numbers would be written as follows:
```java
public static int calculateSum(int first,int second){
   int sum =Â  first + second;
   return sum;
}
```
* All methods have two parts a **method header** and a **method body**.
* The method body holds the lines of code that "do" something.
* The method header gives basic information about the method.
   * The first part of the header is an **access modifier**. This part decides whether other classes can use a class or the members of a class. The four main types of modifiers are:
      * Private - accessed only within a private group
      * Public - accessed not only within a class, but also from outside
      * Default - accessed only within a specific package
      * Protected - accessible to a class and its subclasses
   * The next portion tells the computer if the method will be **static** or **instance**.
      * A static method can be called without creating an object of the class (just like the Math.random() and System.out.println() methods we used!).
      * An instance method needs the creation of an instance in order to run the method (just like the scanner object methods we used!).
   * After the type of method the return value datatype is added. Use **void** if there is no return value.
   * The return value is followed by the method name. Make sure to use camalCase if needed.
   * Finally inside the parenthesis are the parameters, or variables, we will be using within the method. This allows us to pass the variables through the method without declaring them inside it.


## In Class Assignment
* Write a java class that computes the a designated amount of numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.
* Write a java class that asks the user to guess a color that the computer randomly chooses from an array.
* Add in the same feature from the number guessing game.
* **Advanced:**  Write a program using the for loop that prints your moon weight for the next 15 years, assuming you gain a kilo every year.
